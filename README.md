This is a special matrix-free version of POGS. See [these papers](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/abs_ops.html) for further details on matrix-free solvers.

### Using matrix-free POGS

First switch to the ``cone`` branch of ``mf_pogs``.
Matrix-free POGS can only be called via CVXPY. You must also install the [FAO_DAG](https://github.com/mfopt/FAO_DAG) package.
See the instructions on the [FAO_DAG page](https://github.com/mfopt/FAO_DAG) for further details on installing and using matrix-free POGS.
