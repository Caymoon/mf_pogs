### Setup

Once you have downloaded POGS, open MATLAB and type

~~~
>> cd <pogs>/src/interface_matlab
~~~

in the MATLAB console. The string `<pogs>` must be replaced with the directory to which POGS was downloaded. To compile wrapper type

~~~
>> pogs_setup
~~~

Alternatively typing 

~~~
>> pogs_setup gpu
~~~

will compile the GPU version.


### MATLAB-specific usage

The MATLAB interface is a single MEX-function, with signature 

~~~ matlab
[x, y, l, optval] = pogs(A, f, g, params)
~~~

Inputs:

  + `A` is the data matrix of dimension \\(m n\\).
  + `f` and `g` are structs with fields `h`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `e`, each of which must either be a vector of dimension \\( m \\) (resp. \\( n \\)) or a scalar. If a scalar is specified, then it is assumed that the scalar should be repeated \\( m \\) (resp. \\( n \\)) times. Multiple problems can be solved with the same matrix \\( A \\), if `f` and `g` are specified as struct arrays.

Optional Inputs:

  + `params` is a struct with fields `rel_tol`, `abs_tol`, `rho`, `max_iter`, `quiet` and `adaptive_rho`.

Outputs:

  + `x` and `y` are the solution vectors \\(x^\\star\_\\text{pogs}\\) resp. \\(y^\\star\_\\text{pogs}\\), and have dimension \\( m \\) resp. \\( n \\).
  + `l` is the dual variable \\(\\lambda^\\star\_\\text{pogs}\\) corresponding to the constraint \\(Ax = y\\) and has dimension \\( m \\).
  + `optval` is the value of the objective \\(p^\\star\_\\text{pogs}\\) at the solution (\\(p^\\star\_\\text{pogs} = f(y^\\star\_\\text{pogs}) + g(x^\\star\_\\text{pogs})\\)).


For more information type

~~~
>> help pogs
~~~

### \\(h\\)-Functions

The values `f.h` and `g.h` can be specified using one of 16 functions. These are 

~~~
kAbs,      kExp,     kHuber,   kIdentity, kIndBox01, kIndEq0,  kIndGe0,  kIndLe0,
kLogistic, kMaxNeg0, kMaxPos0, kNegEntr,  kNegLog,   kRecipr,  kSquare,  kZero
~~~

For example to specify that \\(g\_j(x\_j) = \|x_j\|\\) for \\(j = 1\\ldots 4\\) and \\(g\_5(x\_5) = I(x\_5 = 0)\\), use the syntax

~~~
>> g.h = [kAbs(4); kIndEq0];
~~~

See [Functions](http://foges.github.io/pogs/ref/functions) for a more detailed explanation of the functions and their usage.
